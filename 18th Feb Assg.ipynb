    "\"Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\"\n",
    "Ans : \n",
    "    An API, which stands for Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols \n",
    "    that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how \n",
    "    different components of software systems should interact, enabling developers to access certain \n",
    "    features or data from another application, service, or platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An example of API usage in real life is the integration of third-party applications with social\n",
    "    media platforms. For instance, Facebook provides an API that allows developers to interact with \n",
    "    their platform and build applications that can access user data, post updates, and perform various \n",
    "    actions on behalf of users. This API enables developers to create Facebook login functionality on \n",
    "    their websites or develop applications that can share content directly to Facebook. By utilizing the\n",
    "    Facebook API, developers can leverage the existing infrastructure and capabilities of the social \n",

    "REST Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "  *  REST is like having a simple conversation between systems over the internet.\n",
    "  *  It uses standard web protocols (URLs and HTTP) that we use every day to browse the internet.\n",
    "  *  It follows a \"request and response\" approach, where one system sends a request for data, and \n",
    "     the other system responds with the requested data.\n",
    "  *  It is lightweight and easy to understand, making it suitable for most applications.\n",
    "     It allows flexibility in how data is requested and sent.\n",
    "    \n",
    "SOAP Architecture:\n",
    "    \n",
    "  * SOAP is like having a structured and formalized conversation between systems.\n",
    "  * It uses a standardized set of rules & formats for sending messages b/w systems,typically based on XML.\n",
    "  * SOAP can handle complex operations, security features, and other advanced functionalities \n",
    "    required in enterprise systems.\n",
    "  * It can use different protocols (like HTTP, SMTP, etc.) for communication, providing \n",
    "    flexibility in system integration.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Mention shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "    SOAP is shortcomings include complexity, overhead, limited compatibility, lack of simplicity, \n",
    "    and potential firewall and proxy issues. These factors can make SOAP less favorable in scenarios\n",
    "    where lightweight, simpler, and more easily compatible communication methods like REST are sufficient."
